KH2FM_Toolkit
=============

The main toolkit I made.
I deleted some stuff in it before putting it open source but afaik all should work as before.
Expect a lot of crappy stuff, didn't wanted at first to make it open source.

Actually fwiw I'm actually doing a complete C++ reprogramming of this toolkit, making it
even faster and more portable than before. I changed several things and used few tricks to
make it even faster and made the basics of a quick patch feature(no that's not the replacer)
which for now have all the pros of the actual patching system without the cons(aka time and CPU
cycles/buffer flush used)
Thougt it'd be a cool idea to tell it here.
